      <description>&lt;p&gt;The episode begins with &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Princess&#34;&gt;Doctor Princess&lt;/a&gt; examining Finn&amp;rsquo;s flower arm, which is seen dull and has wilted some petals. He said that he had been drinking pickle juice a lot, but Doctor Princess told him to switch back to water. After this, she asks him how is he feeling, to which he replies he doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything and slumps out of the bed. Doctor Princess tells that that&amp;rsquo;s the reason and also that because his dad took his arm, his flower is starting to wilt and he is falling into depression. She tells him to have fun for the flower to continue its good growth, and Finn tells that she should come with him to &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Crab_Princess&#34;&gt;Crab Princess&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; party, to which she confusedly asks as a date. Finn replies yes, but she denies him, telling she doesn&amp;rsquo;t date her patients. Finn then walks out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to a forest in which Finn was passing while slumping his body. While he was walking, he started to sing &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Lost_in_the_Darkness/Love&#34;&gt;Lost in the Darkness/Love&lt;/a&gt;, and while he was singing, a bee sees his flower and is attracted to it. The bee follows Finn to the party, where it is shown many princesses have arrived. Princess Bubblegum hosts as the DJ and all the others at the party start to dance while Finn sits on a near log with &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Raggedy_Princess&#34;&gt;Raggedy Princess&lt;/a&gt;. She asks Finn to help her pour juice from her cup into her mouth, as she couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. Finn didn&amp;rsquo;t answer back as the bee annoys him by buzzing near his face. She tells him she can&amp;rsquo;t drink it, and asks his help. Finn is getting annoyed by the bee, as it constantly gets near to him and buzzes near his face. He tells the bee to cut it out, to which the bee apologizes, and says that she didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that the flower was attached to Finn&amp;rsquo;s arm. The bee says that the flower on Finn&amp;rsquo;s arm is the greatest miracle and she is completely attracted to it. Finn thanks her, and the bee introduces herself as &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Breezy_(character)&#34;&gt;Breezy&lt;/a&gt;. Raggedy Princess somehow got the juice all over her face and went out to dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breezy wants the flower, so she gets very nervous. She asks Finn why he is there, to which he replies that he is there to make out with Crab Princess. Since Breezy is into the flower, she agrees to help Finn with his plans. Breezy sneaks near Crab Princess and hears that she wanted someone who could dance well. Breezy tells Finn, and he starts to dance and all princesses applaud his act. Crab Princess blushes as the scene changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is seen that Finn eventually took her home, and drops her. She thanks Finn for walking her home, and Finn finally asks Crab Princess to get a kiss. She agrees and both of them kiss. Finn then bids her goodnight, to which Crab Princess replies happily and goes back to her home. Breezy congratulates Finn on his success. She then asks him how he feels, to which he says he is good, but cannot feel anything. He concludes if he made out with lots of girls, maybe he would feel something. Breezy gets near the flower, and seeing that it is good shape. Finn appreciates her help, and tells that she is a good wingman. Breezy appreciates this, and says she will help Finn to get more make outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to Breezy and Finn going to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Lizard_Kingdom&#34;&gt;Lizard Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. They spy on &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Lizard_Princess&#34;&gt;Lizard Princess&lt;/a&gt; and Breezy whispers something to Finn and suddenly pushes him to go make out with her. Finn goes near Lizard Princess and takes the trumpet she was blowing. He plays good music that Lizard Princess is impressed by, and they kiss. Then everyone starts to dance as Finn plays the trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to now &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Muscle_Princess&#34;&gt;Muscle Princess&lt;/a&gt; dancing with Finn. Breezy tries to go near Finn&amp;rsquo;s flower, but since he is dancing and moving his arm, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a hold. Breezy notices that Muscle Princess is sweating, so she gives Finn a towel to help Muscle Princess wipe it off. Finn wipes it off and they then kiss each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jake&#34;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt; skateboarding near the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Tree_Fort&#34;&gt;Tree Fort&lt;/a&gt; where there are many ladies in wait. He goes inside to see Finn with a princess. She introduces herself as &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen_Yogurt_Princess&#34;&gt;Frozen Yogurt Princess&lt;/a&gt;. Jake then says she is looking like somewhat a mix between &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum&#34;&gt;Princess Bubblegum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Flame_Princess&#34;&gt;Flame Princess&lt;/a&gt;, and so Jake teases Finn that he isn&amp;rsquo;t over with both of them. Finn gets angry and leaves with Breezy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn tells Breezy, that he is just having fun, which is the doctor&amp;rsquo;s order. He also says but this isn&amp;rsquo;t helping him, and he should let the flower die. Breezy tells Finn that he has a responsibility to the flower. She also says she has responsibilities, as she was born as a virgin Queen Bee. She said that once she drinks the Royal Jelly, she will not be free as she is now. Finn tells her to stay free always, to which she agrees. She gets excited and suddenly she says that they should make out with each other, hinting she is attracted to him. Finn then gets confused while Breezy tries to cover up what she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they run by a river, she faked an accident into bumping Finn to get hold of the flower, but they both fall in the river. As Finn floats on the river with Breezy atop, a male bee sees her and tells her to get back to her hive. She refuses and tells she has a carefree life and Finn agrees. Suddenly the bee calls more of his friends to deal with Finn. Finn starts to get attacked by them and fights them back but in vain. Breezy then goes to the hive of the male bees and comes back with a bottle of Royal Jelly. She tells him to not worry and she drinks the Royal Jelly. Breezy starts to transform in more humanoid type and bigger than Finn. She can now control the male bees and throws them back to their house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breezy then tells she has become a Queen to save Finn, and also admits that she only wanted to help because she was attracted to the flower. She confesses that after hanging out with Finn, she loves him. She then tells Finn that he can partake at her pollen crumbles and become her drone. Finn appreciates this but tells Breezy that he wants to keep their relationship simple, and so Breezy gets hurt. She flies away while crying. The scene changes to Finn being with LSP and dancing. She tells him to stop dancing and to start making out. They both kiss, and Finn starts to go. To Finn one kiss is making out, but for LSP that&amp;rsquo;s not enough. She stops Finn and they make out LSP style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to Finn lying down. Finn then asks his flower arm if it was okay. It wilts, so he sends his memory of the &amp;ldquo;LSP make-out&amp;rdquo; into his mental vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many fireflies flying and suddenly, the shadow of Breezy appears. She starts to sing, which helps the flower. Finn starts to sing with her unconsciously. When Finn notices Breezy, he sees her as Princess Bubblegum, holding a sword (which would later become known as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Finn_Sword&#34;&gt;Finn Sword&lt;/a&gt;). As soon as Breezy finishes the song, Finn&amp;rsquo;s flower arm grows into a great flowering tree and breaks. After ripping the remaining bark off, Finn sees a new arm covered in honey, with a thorn in it. Finn flicks the honey off to see that his original arm has grown back, and he starts to dance in joy. LSP wakes up to see Finn has gotten his arm back, and she was happy for him. Finn notices Breezy and his flower falling on her head. The episode ends with Breezy kissing the flower.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>James II (Season 6)</title>
      <link>http://example.com/posts/season-6-james-ii/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The episode begins with Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum walking and looking for a flower called a Weeping Willy. Once they find it, they start collecting its tears, when Clone James fakes his death claiming that the ground below Bubblegum is loose and performs a fake attempt to save her. He falls into the river and yells, &amp;ldquo;Remember me!&amp;rdquo;. A flashback is shown of the occurrences of the episode &amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/James&#34;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Finn and Jake feel sorry for him, pointing out that it was the 25th time James had sacrificed himself for Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum then tells them that James faked his death, and points out that the ground near the flower is perfectly solid, and there is no possibility of her falling into the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn and Jake then tell her to bring him back by cloning him, but she tells them that the fake deaths are getting out of hand and it is pointless to award him for his foolish behavior. She says that it&amp;rsquo;s time for him to go into an eternal nap. Finn and Jake protest against her and persuade her to bring him back, but she stands on her ground and declares that there would be no more Jameses. She then tells Finn and Jake to clean up James&amp;rsquo;s apartment to which they reluctantly agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they make their way to his apartment, they start talking about his &amp;lsquo;sacrifices&amp;rsquo;, like eating a contaminated cupcake for PB. When they reach the apartment, open the door and switch on the lights they are surprised to find lots of Jameses and ask them who&amp;rsquo;s in charge. A clone James comes forward wearing a lot of medals and introduces himself as James #2. They ask him to explain the scene, to which he replies he was lonely, and wanted more companionship. He knew PB wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make another James, unless he died a hero, so he started faking his death to collect medals, saying that medals make him happy. Jake tells Finn that Princess would be upset about this, to which James #2 gets scared and tells them not to convey this to her. He also tries to bribe them by giving them a medal, but the duo refuse. They say that they won&amp;rsquo;t warn the Princess, because she will eventually find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn and Jake go outside and then sit on a bench, laughing at the scene. After some time, they see the Princess whistling and going to James&amp;rsquo; apartment. As soon as Princess enters the building, she shouts, &amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; and all of the Jameses start running out of the house to random places. Finn and Jake enjoy it and laugh. The scene then changes and shows the original James and other Goo Monsters heading out of the pit and towards the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene then returns to the Candy Kingdom, showing Finn and Jake sitting on the walls of the kingdom, and looking below. They see the Princess assembling the Banana Guards and showing them a picture of James. The Banana Guards understand, but as soon as Princess says there are 25 of them, the Banana Guards get all confused and ask questions, such as &amp;ldquo;How can one picture identify all 25?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Are they brothers?&amp;rdquo; Princess Bubblegum angrily answers their questions. Finn and Jake laugh at their stupidity, when PB notices them and asks for their help. They invite her to their place, and she goes along, while muttering. She arrives at their place, and asks why they are sitting down doing nothing. Jake tells her to sit for 5 minutes and enjoy it. She sits down, and Jake offers her some wall candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They look below as a Clone James comes to their place. The Banana Guards don&amp;rsquo;t identify him, and even ask him if he has seen the James in the picture. Even Clone James couldn&amp;rsquo;t identify himself which causes the three watching from above to laugh. Eventually, all the Jameses try and cannot identify their own picture. The Banana Guard in charge takes the photo back and asks the name of the first Clone James. He then asks all their names and all of them claim to be &amp;lsquo;James&amp;rsquo;, and say that their names are the same, &amp;ldquo;because they look alike.&amp;rdquo; The Banana Guard then comes to a random conclusion that they are brothers, to which the Jameses reply otherwise. The Banana Guard counts them but the Clone Jameses reassures that there are 25 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Banana Guard then puts his mental power to work and recalls the orders of PB. He then tells his other guards that they are the guys Princess was talking about.They finally try to capture them while Finn, Jake, and PB laugh at this. The scene then changes to the Banana Guards randomly trying to capture all the Jameses, and in the end, they manage to capture them all. While all this is happening, the Original James and the horde of Goo Monsters arrive at Candy Kingdom, unnoticed. Princess Bubblegum arrives at the place where all Jameses are captured, and snatches their medals, saying they are not heroes. Suddenly, a Gumball Guardian shouts, &amp;ldquo;Evil presence detected!&amp;rdquo; and points to the horde of Goo Monsters. The Banana Guards are then ordered to protect the Candy Kingdom. They obey the order, but since they don&amp;rsquo;t usually fight, some fake their death and one even jabs a spear into his body to fake it. Finn intervenes and uses the spear to attack the Monsters, but on contact with their bodies, the spear melts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn then warns everyone not to touch them, as anything that touches them melts. The Banana Guards get scared and run into the kingdom. Finn notices some Candy Orphans playing there. He asks Jake for help to bring them inside the kingdom. As they get busy with this task, the Jameses notice PB in danger. They notice the Original James attacking her, and then try to save her by dogpiling on him and fusing together. This causes the Original James to be fused with the clones and be killed. The Jameses say, &amp;ldquo;We told you we were heroes!&amp;rdquo;. Afterwards, Princess Bubblegum awards the medals back to the Jameses. She then gives them a new assignment, which is to &amp;ldquo;go to the wasteland and never come back.&amp;rdquo; The Jameses protest, but Princess Bubblegum interrupts them and tells them she would send them a medal every day. They agree to this and run to the wasteland. The episode ends with Princess Bubblegum saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna miss him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
